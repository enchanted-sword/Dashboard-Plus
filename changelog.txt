v1.3.2

general

- added a fallback for the fallback for root node race conditions so the mutuation observer shouldn't fail to init in rare cases
- fixed the IDB upgrade routine checking `IDBObjectStore.index()` as a index deletion condition and throwing `NotFoundErrors` when attempting to upgrade

show mutuals

- added an "uncoloured" option that inherits the default blog link text colour
- fixed mutual icons not being shown on link of the blog being reblogged from

post finder

- replaced the slow post index arrays with much faster sets, which greatly increases cursor seek times (up to 4000 keys/second)
- added an "autosync" feature which automatically propagates updates to the live index progress/search progress counters every few seconds so they don't seem frozen during slow operations (as they normally only update once for every 100 increments)
- added better post renderer error handling so a single dubiously indexed post will no longer cause an entire page of search results to fail to display

new feature! post finder

- indexes posts you've seen before in your browser storage and turns them into a searchable database!
- you can search multiple keywords, with the option to split keywords with either commas or spaces (replace spaces inside keywords with underscores)
- you can also filter _out_ keywords by prefixing them with a hyphen (-)
